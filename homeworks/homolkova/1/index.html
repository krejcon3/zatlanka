					<h2>Thoroughbred</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p class="r">Throughout equine history few breeds have impacted the horse world quite like the Thoroughbred. Three foundation sires, the Byerly Turk, the Godolphin Arabian and the Darley Arabian, were bred to native English horses to create the breed in the early 17th century. The Thoroughbred first made its mark as a racehorse, shaping a sport so favored by the gentry that racing was dubbed the sport of kings. With its famous speed and stamina, the Thoroughbred quickly found its way into other sports, such as hunting, jumping, dressage and eventing. It has contributed its bloodlines to many breeds, including European warmbloods and the American Quarter Horse.</p>

					<h2>Tennessee Walking</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p class="b">The Tennessee Walking Horse is an American original, developed in central Tennessee in the late 1800s. The horse�s genealogy includes a mixture of breeds that settlers brought with them, such as Morgans, Narragansett Pacer and Canadian Horses. One characteristic of this new breed was the horse�s smooth gait, which was later called the running walk. This gait replaced the ordinary bouncy trot and made it easy for farmers, deliverymen and doctors to sit for hours in the saddle. The Tennessee Walker is shown English and western, and they are prized mounts for leisure riding and trail.</p>

					<h2>Friesian</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p class="b">The Friesian is one of Europe�s oldest breeds and gets its name from the Friesland region in the north of the Netherlands. The breed almost became extinct worldwide during the turn of the 20th century, as many Friesians were crossed to other breeds to create a faster horse for trotting races. In fact, only three purebred stallions were left. While World War II very nearly destroyed other breeds, it actually brought the Friesian back from the brink of extinction. Due to the fuel shortages, Dutch farmers turned to horses for transportation and fieldwork. The Friesian is one of the best carriage horses in the world. Today the breed is an accomplished dressage horse.</p>
